<h3 align='center'><em>The funny dice game for everyone!</em></h3>

## Equipment 👐 
- A smartphone 📱
- Friends

## Setup ⚙️
A smartphone 📱 is needed. All players should be at a table or in a circle 🪑 so that passing the smartphone 📱 is as easy as possible.

## Goal 🥅
The objective of the game is to roll a 21 (Mayer) 🎲 or to reveal a lie 🤥 of the accuser.

## Values 🔢
In classic Poschen, the higher value of a die is interpreted as a tens digit and the lower value as a ones digit.

The order of possible number combinations in ascending value: 31, 32, 41, 42, 43, 52, 53, 54, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65. **65** is the highest number combination that is not a Posch and not a Mayer 🎲. It can only be beaten by them.

## Special number combinations 🎲
11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66. These are called one posch, two posch, three posch, four posch, five posch and six posch. A six posch is the second highest number combination.

## Mayer 🎲
Mayer 🎲 is the number combination 21. It is the highest number combination and cannot be beaten.
 
## This is how it works 💻
The first player starts and shakes the phone. He may then look under the glasses pocket. The first player enters a number and then says the number and passes the smartphone 📱 to the second player. The first player may announce a number (or a posch/mayer) and may lie 🤥 while doing so.

### The second player now has two options 🙋:

**First - he believes the player: ✅**

If he believes the first player, he is not allowed to check if the mentioned number of the first player was a lie 🤥. He must now shake the smartphone 📱 and announce a number that must be higher than the first player's (his foreplayer's) named number. Even if his rolled number is lower. He hands the smartphone 📱 to the next player after announcing. The next player again has these two options.

**Second - he does not believe the player: ❌**

If he thinks the player lied 🤥 when announcing his number, he may open the glasses pocket and must show the dice to the round. If the announced value of the first player (his predecessor) is not correct, but is lower than his rolled result, the predecessor loses one life. If the previous player's value is correct, or if the previous player's rolled value is greater than the announced value, the player who accused the previous player of lying must subtract one life.

After uncovering, the game starts again from the beginning. The player who was the last to accuse another player of lying may start.

If a player declares a Mayer (21) 🎲, the next player may of course uncover and accuse him of lying, or he may try to roll a Mayer 🎲 himself. If the player fakes a Mayer 🎲 and it is revealed, the previous player gets two lives subtracted. If it is revealed and there is actually a Mayer 🎲 in the glasses pocket, the player gets two lives deducted.
